## The first 3 variables Activity_Labels, labels and subjects are factor variables giving the Activity Description, Activity ID and Subject ID respectively.

## Rest metrics are the average of all the numeric variables in merged dataset of test and training corresponding to that combination of Subject & Activity. Their names and units are retained as they were in these raw datasets but an "Avg" before them since they represent their means for that subject & activity.
